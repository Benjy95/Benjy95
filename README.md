- 👋 Hi, I’m @Benjy95
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D / VR / AR / Interaction Design / Science / Engineering / Video Games / Music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Carbon language and SLang shaders, as I try to get back to programming via personal projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects, by starting with "baby steps" but clean contributions.
- 📫 How to reach me : maybe later...
